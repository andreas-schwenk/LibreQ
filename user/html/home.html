<h1>LibreQ</h1>

  LibreQ is a free and flexible toolkit for organizing, tagging, and sharing
  Moodle questions across departments or entire schools. It supports
  collaborative development of high quality educational content while allowing
  each institution to define its own structure and workflows.

  Teachers and subject coordinators can build shared question collections, apply
  custom classifications, and make selected content available for others to use.
  All data remains under your control and can be tailored to meet your
  curriculum or assessment needs.

  This platform is designed to support open education and long term reuse of
  digital learning materials.
